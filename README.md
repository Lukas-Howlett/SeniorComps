First and foremost it is essential that the package "2D Tilemap Editor" is installed from Unity's built-in package manager tool.

To utilize these files you must place them all into an exisiting 2D unity project's assets folder. From the assets folder, you can open 
SampleScene.unity by double clicking it and it should already have all the prefabs in the scene view. You can also drag additional prefabs
to the scene view if you wish.
